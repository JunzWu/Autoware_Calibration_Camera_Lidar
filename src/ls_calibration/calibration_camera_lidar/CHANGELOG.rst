1.1.2 (2017-02-27 23:10)
------------------------

1.1.1 (2017-02-27 22:25)
------------------------

1.1.0 (2017-02-24)
------------------

1.0.1 (2017-01-14)
------------------

1.0.0 (2016-12-22)
------------------
* Add module graph tool
* Remove needless compiling flags
* Fix for rosjava installed platform
  Some packages don't declare package dependencies correctly.
  This makes message jar files built failure.
* Modify to get camera ID from runtime manager
  * Make it possible to obtain camera ID in each node to subscribe topics
  under camera name space selectively
  * Get image size from sensor_msgs::Image instead of CameraInfo
* Support bayerformat in CalibrationToolKit
  16bit bayer images are not supprted
  as cvtColor function in OpenCV doesn't support them.
* Apply same image receive method to calibrationtoolkit
* Change frame ID according to used camera
* Add dialog to specify camera name
  Now we can select camera to be used in calibration
* Make image source selectable
* Set topic name according to the number of connected camera
  Because calibration_publisher should publish each camera information
  when multiple cameras are connected to the system.
  In that case, calibration_publisher.launch must be executed with
  "name_space" argument that specifies corresponded camera.
* Refactoring CMakeLists.txt
  Remove absolute paths by using cmake features and pkg-config.
* fixed calibration bug's & cosmetic changes
* modified scan2image and calibration_test for calibration_publisher
* Clean up Qt5 configuration
  Use pkg-config as possible instead of absolute pathes.
* Use c++11 option instead of c++0x
  We can use newer compilers which support 'c++11' option
* Initial commit for public release
